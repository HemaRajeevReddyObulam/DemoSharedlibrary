what is the build and deployment process?

GitHub is a repository where the project source code will be maintained 
then build a deployment take the latest source code from the GitHub.
compile the project to source code execute the unit test cases perform.
the code review using Sonar package 
the application as a jar file or War file 
upload the build artifact into Nexus and
deploy the application in the server so this is build and deployment process


so for every project build and deployment is a mandatory 
because whatever the code we are writing that code 
we cannot give to the client directly 
that code should be compiled 
the code should be tested 
that code should be reviewed 
that code should be packaged as a war file or jar file
we need to keep the code in the backup then
we need to deploy the project in the server 
if the project is deployed in the server then only we can access that
project but here once the coding is completed.
 
================================================================================================================
we are not going to give the code to the client directly 
because we need to test it to test that code several environments will
be available like a dev environment QA environment uat environment and prod environment like this several
environments will be available (in the several environments will be available) in the project.


 several environments will be available in the project okay 
------------------------------------------------------
what is the purpose of this environment ?
 		---------------------------
These environments are used to test our application 
Dev environment will be used by developers 
QA will be used by testers 
uat will be used by clients 
pilot will be used for performance testing 

once the code is passed in all these environments finally it will go for production.

=====================================================================================================


 so whatever the code we are writing or whatever the code we are changing 
that should be deployed into multiple environments like this Devo QA Devo QA
uat pilot prod like this multiple environments will be available 



what is the environment & Environment Applications?
---------------------------------------------------
Environment is a platform which is used to run our application develop

Environment Applications:-
Dev environment:-developers will use to perform integration testing 
QA testers will use to perform functional testing 
uat user acceptance testing 

pilot (or) pre-prod environment performance testing will be done
prod live environment End users
will access application running in the production environment

===================================================================================================== 

so development team is responsible for development activity 
testing team is responsible for testing activity 
operations team is responsible for build and deployment activity 
this operations team is called as the devops team 

okay development plus operations is called as devops

devops is a process which is used to collaborate development teamwork and operations teamwork 
okay using devops process we can simplify application build and deployment process 
okay
 

===================================================================================================

What are Challenges in Bulid And Deployment Process?
 	   --------	-    --------------------------


in order to do this process manually there are some challenges available
 
Every day we need to deploy the latest code to the environment 
Dev environment QA environment uat environment and prod environment 

so if you need to do the deployment manually it will take lot of

time and we need to deploy the code not in one environment 
we need to deploy the code in multiple environments 
if you want to deploy the code in multiple environments
it will take lot of time and it is a repeated work and 
it is error prone repeated work and error prone got it so to avoid this manual problems 



we are going to automate to automate the build and deployment
we have a software in the market that is the Jenkins 
that is Jenkins is free that

 so by using this is Jenkins whatever the work that we are

doing manually that work can be automated 
okay 

============================================================================================

so what is this Jenkins ?

Jenkins is a free and open source software 
Jenkins developed using Java language 
Jenkins is used to automate build on the deployment process 
using Jenkins 
we can Implement CI CD 


what is a CI CD ?


{cicd is one process which is used to simplify the deployment process 
  which is used to automate the deployment process }


cicd is one of the trending approach in the development life cycle
cicd is used to Simply  and automate project deployment and delivery process 

okay 

guys CI continuous integration CD continuous delivery and continuous deployment 


continuous integration

 when code changes happened it should be ready to test
 when we do the code changes that code should be ready to test 

continuous delivery
 
keep that code ready to release in the Repository 
(keep the code ready in repository to)
(release keep it ready in repository for release)
(keep it ready in repository for release then)

continuous deployment 
                     
release the project to production. 
(release or deploy the project to production) 


when we are going for the deployment 

we need to take a client approval for production deployment 
we need to take client approvals all right
now so these are the things that we have discussed so far it is a theoretical

session completely 

=======================================================================================================================



what is the difference between continuous deployment and continuous delivery okay continuous integration ?

continuous integration means when the code is modified by the developer that the code should be ready for testing (that code should be ready for testing) sir 

continuously delivery means the automatically released to the repository, project is ready to deploy in the production 

continuous deployment means it is a production deployment. 
when we are going for continuous deployment a manual approval is required for the production directly we cannot deploy the code for the production


production means life environment if you do some wrong deployment in the production project will fail so that's




why continuous deployment requires a manual approval if the client is

approved then only we will go for production deployment otherwise we don't go for the production deployment

delivery continuous delivery means making the project ready to deploy in

the production after getting the approval from the client term then we will deploy the project in the

production continuous integration continuous delivery continuous deployment this is the order this is the

order we are going to follow when developer
